The report explains the purpose of this repo. To generate the report, open an R session in the repo's main directory and run `remake::make()`. You will need `chain_list.rds`, which contains MCMC results from the horseshoe analysis of a normal-generated dataset. The file is not included here because it is over 100 MB in size.
